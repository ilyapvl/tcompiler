# TCompiler

A project of tensor compiler that creates an executable file from a model in ONNX formax

## Features

- Load ONNX models (`.onnx`)
- Internal graph representation with:
  - Operations: `Add`, `Mul`, `MatMul`, `Conv2d`, `Gemm`, `Relu`, `Shape`, `Reshape`, `Concat`. See below for more information about operations support
  - Tensors (data type, shape, raw data for constants/weights)
  - Attributes (full support for all ONNX attribute types: float, int, string, tensor, graph, lists, etc.)
- Topological sorting of graph nodes (Kahn’s algorithm)
- Export to GraphViz DOT format
- Generating a MLIR representation of the loaded model, saving it to a file
- Lowering all MLIR dialects to llvm dialect, converting to LLVM IR and generating obj files for different architectures
- Testing using GoogleTest

## Dependencies

- **C++20** compiler
- **CMake** 3.20 or higher
- **Protobuf** (libprotobuf) – used for ONNX parsing
- **LLVM (MLIR)** 22.1.1 or higher
- **GoogleTest** – for tests (automatically fetched via CMake)

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler graphviz
# LLVM/MLIR is typically built from source
```

On macOS with Homebrew:
```
brew install protobuf graphviz llvm
```



## Building

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ilyapvl/tcompiler.git
cd tcompiler
```

Create a build directory and configure:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

File `onnx.proto3` will be downloaded

Build the project:

```
make
```

This will build C++ from `proto` using protobuf compiler. Files `onnx.pb.h` and `onnx.pb.cc` will be created and put in `PROTO_GEN_DIR`.

Then, these files will be produced:
- `libtc_lib.a` – static library
- `tcompiler` – executable

## Usage

### Command line

```
./tcompiler <model.onnx> [mlir-opptions...]
```

- `<model.onnx>` – input ONNX model file.

### Options
- `--print-mlir` — Print MLIR before optimisation
- `--mlir-out <path>` — Write MLIR module to file
- `--target-triple=<llvm_triple>` — Target triple for obj generating. Default is arm64-bare-metal
- `--cpu=<cpu>` — CPU type for obj generating. Default is generic
- `--features=<features>` — Features for obj generating. Default is none
- `-o <filename>` — Filename of the final obj file. Default is "out.s"

### Example

```
./tcompiler ../models/test_model.onnx --print-mlir --mlir-out output.mlir --target-triple="x86_64-pc-linux" -o model.o
```

File `graph.dot` with a DOT representation of a graph will be created.

The program also prints debug info:
- Model metadata (version, producer, etc.)
- Graph summary (number of nodes, tensors, inputs, outputs, operation breakdown)
- Topological order of nodes

## Currentry implemented operations
### Add/Mul

Addition/multiplication of two tensors A and B. Supports NumPy‑style broadcasting. The result is a tensor with the shape obtained after broadcasting. For example, `Add(tensor1<?x5x32x32>, tensor2<1x1>) = tensor3<?x5x32x32>`



### MatMul

Performs matrix multiplication. If tensors have rank > 2, the leading dimensions are treated as batch dimensions and multiplication is performed for each matrix pair in the batch. For example, `MatMul(tensor1<?x3x4x5>, tensor2<1x5x6>) = tensor3<?x3x4x6>`



### Gemm
General matrix multiplication. Computes `Y = alpha * A * B + beta * C` with transpositions of matrices possible. Built on `Add`, `Mul` and `MatMul`.



### Relu
Returns `max(0, x)` elementwise


### Shape
Returns the shape of the input tensor as a 1D integer tensor. For example, `Shape(tensor1<?x3x5x5>) = tensor2<4>` with values `[tensor.dim, 3, 5, 5]`


### Reshape
Transforms a tensor to a new shape. Allowed values in shape tensor are `positive_integer`, `0`, `-1` where `0` means either "take from input" (`allowzero == false`) or "set explicitly to zero" (`allowzero == true`), and `-1` means infer the dimension from other. No more than one `-1` dimension is allowed. For example, `Reshape(tensor1<?x3x32x32>, tensor2<3> [0, -1, 16]) = tensor3<?x192x16>`. Be careful when reshaping tensors with dynamic dimensions


### Concat
Returns the concatenated by `axis`. For example, `Concat(tensor1<2x3x4x4>, tensor2<2x2x4x4>, axis = 1) = tensor3<2x5x4x4>`


### Conv2d
Returns 2d convolution of a tensor. Input and kernel must have `rank = 4`. Supports grouped convolution. For example, `Conv2d(input<1x8x32x32>, kernel<12x2x3x3>, group = 4) = tensor<1x12x30x30>`


## Code generation
Currently there are problems with bufferizing MLIR IR from C++ code, so `--one-shot-bufferize` pass is performed by an external call to `mlir-opt` (found automatically by CMake). All other lowering passes are done in `runLoweringPipeline()` internally. Current llvm optimization level is None, optimizing passes will be implemented

## Running
To run a compiled program, you need to link its obj file with libmlir_c_runner_utils library. Also you need a driver - an external program that is responsible for transmitting and recieving data. Loading data from external files is also left to driver. Driver's realization should not depend on a platform; however, `driver.cpp` file given here was only tested on Apple arm64 with arm64-apple-darwin target triple. To build the final executable, run those commands:

- `./tcompiler ../models/test_model.onnx --target-triple="arm64-apple-darwin" -o model.o`
- `clang++ -c ../driver.cpp -o driver.o`
- `clang++ driver.o model.o -L${MLIR_LIBRARY_PATH} -lmlir_c_runner_utils -o main_model`
- `./main_model`


This driver runs a simple `test_model.onnx` (see `test.py` to see how the model was built) and checks the result

## Testing

Run all tests:

```
cd build
ctest
```

Or run the test executable directly:

```
./tests/tc_tests
```

## Limitations

- Reshape sometimes fail to handle shape tensors with `-1` when applied to an input with dynamic dimension. That is not usually an issue because most widely used batch tensors with shape `<?x...const...>` are processed correctly. Things like `<?x?x...>` will most likely fail.
